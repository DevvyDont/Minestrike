# Minestrike

A 1.15.2 Paper plugin that is meant to bring the Counter-Strike defuse gamemode to Minecraft with "vanilla" pvp mechanics.
Most, if not all servers that have a playable "Counter-Strike mode" are *heavily* modified with custom resource packs, clunky gun emulation, and custom resources for sound clips and fonts that just don't fit in Minecraft. 

With this plugin, we aim to bring the beloved gamemode to vanilla Minecraft PvP.

The core of the defuse gamemode will all be there perfectly preserved, however, combat will involve classic Minecraft sword and bow combat with the exception of a few tweaks and additions to enhance the experience.

All weapons, armor, and equipment availble for purchase in the buy menu will have fine-tuned damage values/attack speeds, movement speed penalties/buffs, or even unique mechanics and/or utility. (Without straying away from the feel of classic Minecraft PvP of course!)

This plugin is for those who love Counter-Strike, but want a classic Minecraft twist on it.

### Note:

This project is mainly being used as a learning resource for spigot minigame development for myself and my friends to cure our eternal boredom in quarantine, and learn something cool in the meantime. It also gives me (dev) an excuse to try out project management tools on Github that I never bothered to actually learn.
